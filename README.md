# SpellingBee

Your goal is to create a program that can solve the New York Times Spelling Bee.

In the `solve.ts` file, you will see a function called `solve`. It takes a list of required letters for example `["a"]` and a list of optional letters `["b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g"]`. The output you produce should be a list of all words that contain all the required letters and only use letters that are either required or optional eg. `["babe", "cage", ...]`. Words must be of length 4 or more.
